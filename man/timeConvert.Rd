\title{Convert Time Zones from GPS collar data
%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
}
\description{
This function converts date-time information from a GPS collar from UTC time to your local time zone. This should be used when GPS collar data is not already converted and you need to keep separate "date" and "time" columns in your data.
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
}
\usage{
timeConvert(ds, date.col, time.col, LocalTZ)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{ds}{The original GPS collar data}
  \item{date.col}{The column containing the original dates that need to be converted}
  \item{time.col}{The column containing the original times that need to be converted}
