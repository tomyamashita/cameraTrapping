Description: This package supports functions used for managing camera trap data (as well as a few other things thrown in). 
    Many of the functions assume a very specific workflow and very likely will not work as intended if this workflow is changed. 
    A description of this workflow will be included with this package for reference.
    If the workflow is not followed, it is likely that the functions here will break. Modify them at your own risk.
